This course will demystify the workings of information technology, making all of these things clear to students. If you are a beginner looking to obtain a tech job or internship or you are a college student looking to get a competitive edge, this course will give you a foundation of basic IT and Computer Engineering knowledge.\n        First, we will look at the basic architecture of a computer, in other words, the parts that make up a computer and what they do. Next, we will look into the concept of networking. Topics explored here will include the 7 layer network model, servers and clients, network topology, and the basic parts of a URL. You will get hands-on experience using proxy software to see requests and responses in real time. Finally, we will look at the basics of the terminal, or command line. We will explore topics like system file structure and hierarchy, basic terminal commands, and will do a hands-on demo of how to use the command line to perform basic operations such as navigating a file directory and performing operations on files.\n\n        By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of the basic internal workings of a computer and the internet. Next time you turn on your computer or type a URL into the search bar, you will understand what is happening and why things work the way they do. Remember, even though technology may seem to work like “magic” it is really just a bunch of 1’s and 0’s communicating with the hardware to perform operations. \nWho this course is for:Anyone who wants to land a job or internship related to technologyAnyone looking to boost their resume with technical skills and know-howHigh school or college students starting classes in IT or Computer EngineeringShow moreShow less",

It involves the design, development, implementation, support, and management of computer-based information systems, including hardware, software, and networks. The field of information technology is broad and encompasses many different subfields, including: Computer programming and software development Database management and administration Network and system administration Cybersecurity and information assurance Web development and design Technical support and helpdesk management Project management and business analysis Artificial intelligence and machine learning Cloud computing and virtualization Digital media and entertainment technology Professionals in the field of IT work in a wide range of industries, including finance, healthcare, government, education, entertainment, and many others. They are responsible for designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining computer-based systems that help organizations manage and use information more effectively. The IT industry is constantly evolving and growing, with new technologies and innovations emerging regularly. As a result, professionals in this field are required to continually learn and adapt to keep up with the latest trends and developments.Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of users.Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of data and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC. However, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that \"the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).\"Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.Information technology is also a branch of computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of procedure, structure, and the processing of various types of data. As this field continues to evolve across the world, the overall priority and importance has also grown, which is where we begin to see the introduction of computer science-related courses in K-12 education. However, concerns have been raised about this fact that most schools are lacking advanced-placement courses in this field.Who this course is for:Who wants to seat for Information Technology ExamShow moreShow less",

Today, the term information has ballooned to encompass many aspects of computing and technology, and the term has become very recognizable. IT professionals perform a variety of duties that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases. A few of the duties that IT professionals perform may include data management, networking, engineering computer hardware, database and software design, as well as the management and administration of entire systems. When computer and communications technologies are combined, the result is information technology, or “infotech”. Information technology is a general term that describes any technology that helps to produce, manipulate, store, communicate, and/or disseminate information. Presumably, when speaking of Information Technology (IT) as a whole, it is noted that the use of computers and information are associated. In recent days ABET and the ACM have collaborated to form accreditation and curriculum standards for degrees in Information Technology as a distinct field of study separate from both Computer Science and Information Systems. Information technology (IT) is the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information by a microelectronics based combination of computing and telecommunications. The term in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review, in which authors Leavitt and Whisler commented that “the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).Who this course is for:ManagersBBA StudentsMBA StudentsProfessionalShow moreShow less",

    "long_desc": "DescriptionCISSP is the gold standard for security certifications. It covers the breadth of information security’s deep technical and managerial concepts. Learning to effectively design, engineer, and manage the overall security posture of an organization. This course covers Domain 1 - Security and Risk Management. This domain is one of the most important domains in the CISSP exam. It lays the foundation, covering security concepts that all the other domains build upon. Understanding exactly what security means and the core concepts around assessing and managing the wide array of risks we face is fundamental to every domain in the CISSP. Domain 2 - Asset Security. An asset is anything we value. When we have highly valued assets, such as sensitive data, securing those assets throughout their lifecycle is paramount. We will learn about data standards, classification, regulations, retention, and controls to protect organizational value. Domain 3 - Security Engineering. Engineering is about understanding and designing systems that work. Security is a fundamental part of any well-designed system. This domain will help you understand the engineering lifecycle and various models and security components required in data structures and physical facilities. We also learn how cryptography fits in to information security. Domain 4 - Communication and Network Security. Information is not just stored; it is also transmitted and must be secured in transit. Understanding networking models, protocols, hardware components, and possible attack vectors is vital to information security. It is one of the most important domains on the CISSP exam. Domain 5 - Identity and Access Management. Controlling who can access valuable resources can lead to proper confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A CISSP must understand mechanisms and techniques to verify a subject’s authenticity before authorizing access. They must be able to assure that only proper interactions have occurred and mitigate potential attacks. Domain 6 - Security Assessment and Testing. Understanding the effectiveness of your security measures is vital. As you collect and review logs, verify software development security, and undergo security audits and certification you can have some assurance and insight into your security status and needs. Domain 7- Security Operations. From incident response that involves investigation of evidence to facility access management and disaster recovery planning, testing, and implementation, this domain requires putting security principles and concepts into practice. Domain 8 - Security in the Software Development Life Cycle. Many of the most publicized security issues have stemmed from flaws in the software code. While a CISSP does not have to be a software developer, they must understand and be able to communicate software development security needs. In this domain you will learn important terminology and concepts of software development.Who this course is for:Network, IT, Server Managers and Security Administrators who want to earn a CISSP CertificateShow moreShow less",
